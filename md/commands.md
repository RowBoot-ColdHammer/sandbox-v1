# make commands by default:

- Create .env from template if missing

- Stop, remove containers, and force-remove images

Notes
- Flags and environment: The Makefile uses a default environment file and docker-compose, assembled via FLAGS. If you need to modify behavior (e.g., switch to a different compose file or env file), adjust DOCKER, ENV_FILE, or FLAGS at the top.
- Safety: Some targets (like docker-clear and volumes-rm) perform destructive actions. Use them only when you intend to remove data.
- Extendability: Consider adding a dedicated help target to list commands and descriptions, or wrapping sensitive steps with confirmations.

If you want, I can tailor the exact README snippet to your repositoryâ€™s branding, include badges, or add a short usage example showing a typical workflow from initialization to startup.
